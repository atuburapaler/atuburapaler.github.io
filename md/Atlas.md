# DVARS
*berko: What's a DVAR? Do i eat it?*
It means **Dynamic variable**, is a configuration variable used to store and manage game settings, it allows you to modify the game’s behavior via scripts or console commands (In this case, we're talking about commands)

*relax-guy: Why does it looks like random letters?*
You're probably looking at a **hash**ed dvar!
A **hash** is a process that converts data into a fixed-length string of characters. In this case, it transforms a **legible dvar** into a **unique identifier**, making it easy to verify but nearly impossible to reverse-engineer. This means that, it's still a dvar, but it **looks different**.

*neutron-star: How do i know what the dvar is for, tho?*
Well, if you can, you read it! Unless the dvar is hashed, the behaviour of it it's pretty much explicit. Here you can see some examples:

## Engine
Early on during Call of Duty development, Infinity Ward modified its own version of the id Tech 3 engine, naming it "IW Engine"
- **IW3** was named after Infinity Ward making **3 titles** (Call of Duty 4 being the last one)
- Eventually, every studio forked and made it's own advancements based on IW3, until the **HQ** concept, which introduced a way of development were every studio works in the **same unified engine line**.
- **IW8** is named after **Infinity Ward's eight** title, **Modern Warfare**. **Vanguard** uses a really really similar engine with some mods, it's called **S4** because it's **Sledgehammer's fourth**.
- **Cold War**, T9, being **Treyarch's ninth** game, is the last title made on their version of the IW engine (Started as a IW3 fork on World at War, T4)
- Then, **IW9** is **named after MWII**. Every other HQ game uses the **same engine**, that's why they use more often **word codenames** instead, because **it's all IW9**.

## Warzone maps
- While Rebirth Island was initially a lore location for Black Ops titles, the place where the nerve gas Nova Six was produced by undercover for the Soviet Union, it turned out to be a location for Warzone "Resurgence" matches (short range combat with a limited respawn period)
During Warzone lifecycle, the island had several changes
