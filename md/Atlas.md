!!! note Hello, friend.
    - This is a work in progress "Atlas" for guiding users in search of fun.
    - If you're reading this, you probably found it by a search engine index or maybe was sent by me.
    - Please note that this is in barebones and the final result it's going to look better.
    - Be sure to use dark mode, and desktop mode. Mobile and light mode don't look good atm.

# Introduction
## DVARS
- %coral%berko:%% *What's a DVAR? Do i eat it?*
It means **Dynamic variable**, is a configuration variable used to store and manage game settings, it allows you to modify the game’s behavior via scripts or console commands (In this case, we're talking about commands)

- *%darkturquoise%relax-guy:%% *Why does it looks like random letters? I dun understand 😩*
You're probably looking at a **hash**ed dvar!
A **hash** is a process that converts data into a fixed-length string of characters. In this case, it transforms a **legible dvar** into a **unique identifier**, making it easy to verify but nearly impossible to reverse-engineer. This means that, it's still a dvar, but it **looks different**.

- *%gold%neutron-star:%% *How do i know what the dvar is for, tho? 😒*
Well, if you can, you read it! Unless the dvar is hashed, the behaviour of it it's pretty much explicit. Here you can see some examples:
`Imagine a picture that explains how it works`

## Codenames
You might have read some code names on dvars, files, or even documentation. Here you can read some:

Code|Meaning

Zeus|This is the codename for Black Ops: Cold War
Fore|This is the codename for Vanguard
Cortez|This is the codename for Modern Warfare II
Jupiter|This is the codename for Modern Warfare III
Warzone|This is the codename for Blackout
Magma|This was the codename for Warzone (2020-2022)

### Engine
Early on during Call of Duty development, Infinity Ward modified its own version of the id Tech 3 engine, naming it "IW Engine"
- **IW3** was named after Infinity Ward making **3 titles** (Call of Duty 4 being the last one)
- Eventually, every studio forked and made it's own advancements based on IW3, until the **HQ** concept, which introduced a way of development were every studio works in the **same unified engine line**.
- **IW8** is named after **Infinity Ward's eight** title, **Modern Warfare**. **Vanguard** uses a really really similar engine with some mods, it's called **S4** because it's **Sledgehammer's fourth**.
- **Cold War**, T9, being **Treyarch's ninth** game, is the last title made on their version of the IW engine (Started as a IW3 fork on WaW, T4)
- Then, **IW9** is **named after MWII**. Every other HQ game uses the **same engine**, that's why they use more often **word codenames** instead, because **it's all IW9**.
