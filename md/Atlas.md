!!! note Hello, friend.
    - This is a work in progress "Atlas" for guiding users in search of fun.
    - If you're reading this, you probably found it by a search engine index or maybe was sent by me.
    - Please note that this is in barebones and the final result it's going to look better.
    - Be sure to use dark mode, and desktop mode. Mobile and light mode don't look good atm.

*%coral%berko:%% What's a DVAR? Do i eat it?*
It means **Dynamic variable**, is a configuration variable used to store and manage game settings, it allows you to modify the game’s behavior via scripts or console commands (In this case, we're talking about commands)

*%darkturquoise%relax-guy:%% Why does it looks like random letters? I dun understand 😩*
You're probably looking at a **hash**ed dvar!
A **hash** is a process that converts data into a fixed-length string of characters. In this case, it transforms a **legible dvar** into a **unique identifier**, making it easy to verify but nearly impossible to reverse-engineer. This means that, it's still a dvar, but it **looks different**.

*%gold%neutron-star:%% How do i know what the dvar is for, tho? 😒*
Well, if you can, you read it! Unless the dvar is hashed, the behaviour of it it's pretty much explicit. Here you can see some examples:
